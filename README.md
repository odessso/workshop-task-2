Here is the URL for the webpage of this project: https://odessso.github.io/workshop-task-2/

## Task Description:

Experiment with using an IDE (VScode). Make a p5.js sketch using the setTimeout and setInterval functions.

## Notes:

- Experimented with time intervals and using mouse click to add more elements to the code
- I enjoy the way that the colours merge together similar to screen pixels
- Experimented with implementing randomness into code - randomising colour and length

## Problems Faced:

- Problems updating the uploaded code - not sure if this is because of the initial upload error.
